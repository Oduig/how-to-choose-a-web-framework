# Courses

While several training agencies offer web-related courses, it should not come as a surprise that the best learning platform for web technology is the web. There are many online courses (“MOOCs”) that offer learning videos and automatically graded programming assignments for free. The only thing you pay is your own time and - often optionally - a fee for a certificate.

## Where to start?

It depends on where you are as a web developer right now. I highly recommend watching the following video: [2016/2017 Must-know web development tech]. The mind map leads you from the basics (HTML, JavaScript and CSS) to an increasingly wide array of frameworks and tools.

Despite the title of that video, you don't need to know all of these technologies to be a web developer. Concepts used in one tool often translate to others. With a little knowledge in each area (scripting, testing, graphical layout, task runner, deployment), you have a solid foundation that will last for years, even if the tools themselves are changing. If you want to become an expert in a single tool, keep in mind that your expertise will be short-lived! Web frameworks have been popping up faster than weeds lately.

## Online courses

You have selected a few tools that you'd like to learn. The best way to learn something is to participate. Go online, find an interactive tutorial or course, and follow the program! If you can't find an interactive course, try a ground-up tutorial. The great thing is that if you have a question about a tool, someone has likely already asked that exact question on StackOverflow. Google is your best friend.

A good resource for online courses is [CourseTalk]. They allow searching through a large number of online course providers such as [Coursera], [Udacity] and [Code Academy].

Other honorable mentions: [Pluralsight], [The Odin Project (Ruby on Rails)], [React Fundamentals].

## Offline courses

The flipside of online courses is that they rely on your own motivation to finish them. If you find yourself unable to learn this way, there are various “offline” courses that you can look in to. Watch out for courses that just show you a lot of slides. As with any technical topic, practice is the only way to really grasp the concepts.
